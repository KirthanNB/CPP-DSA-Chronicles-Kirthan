Single Element in a Sorted Array

Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Example 1:

Input:nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output:2

Example 2:

Input:nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output:10

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

The array is sorted.

Expected Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
