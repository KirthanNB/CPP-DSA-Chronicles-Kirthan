# Peak Element in Mountain Array

[Here's the Leetcode link to Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/description/)

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer mountain array `arr` of length `n` where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [0,1,0]`  
**Output:**  
`1`

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [0,2,1,0]`  
**Output:**  
`1`

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`arr = [0,10,5,2]`  
**Output:**  
`1`

## Constraints:
- `3 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `arr` is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

## Expected Time Complexity
The solution should run in **O(log(n))** time complexity.
